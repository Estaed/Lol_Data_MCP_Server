# Recommendations for `Lol_Data_MCP_Server` Improvement

Based on the analysis of the `saidsurucu/yargi-mcp` repository, here are several recommendations to enhance the architecture, maintainability, and deployment of the `Lol_Data_MCP_Server` project.

## 1. Containerization with Docker

**Observation:** The `yargi-mcp` project includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`, which simplifies deployment and ensures a consistent runtime environment. Our project currently lacks this.

**Recommendation:** Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the `Lol_Data_MCP_Server`.

**Benefits:**
- **Consistency:** The application will run in the same environment, from development to production, eliminating "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Simplified Deployment:** The application can be deployed on any system with Docker installed, including cloud platforms.
- **Dependency Isolation:** All project dependencies are packaged within the container, avoiding conflicts with other applications on the host system.

**Actionable Steps:**
1.  Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root.
2.  The `Dockerfile` should:
    -   Start from a Python base image (e.g., `python:3.9-slim`).
    -   Set up a working directory.
    -   Copy the `requirements.txt` file and install the dependencies.
    -   Copy the rest of the project source code.
    -   Expose the port the FastAPI server runs on (e.g., 8000).
    -   Define the command to run the application (e.g., using `uvicorn`).

## 2. Enhance Modularity

**Observation:** `yargi-mcp` has a highly modular structure where each data source is a self-contained unit. Our project has a good logical structure but can be made more modular.

**Recommendation:** Refactor the `data_sources` directory to treat each scraper or API client as a distinct "plugin."

**Benefits:**
- **Extensibility:** Adding new data sources (e.g., a new API, another website scraper) will be much easier and less likely to break existing code.
- **Maintainability:** Each module can be developed, tested, and debugged independently.
- **Clearer Separation of Concerns:** The core server logic will be cleanly separated from the data-gathering logic.

**Actionable Steps:**
1.  Define a common interface (e.g., an abstract base class) that all data source modules must implement. This interface should define methods like `get_champion_data`, `get_item_data`, etc.
2.  Refactor `wiki_scraper.py` to implement this interface.
3.  The main server logic should discover and load these modules dynamically, rather than being tightly coupled to specific implementations.

## 3. Centralize and Improve Configuration Management

**Observation:** Both projects use `.env.example`, which is good. However, we should ensure *all* configurable parameters are loaded from the environment.

**Recommendation:** Perform a review of the codebase to identify any hardcoded configuration values and move them to environment variables.

**Benefits:**
- **Flexibility:** The application's behavior can be changed without modifying the source code, which is crucial for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
- **Security:** Sensitive information like API keys or database credentials will not be stored in the version control system.

**Actionable Steps:**
1.  Identify hardcoded values in `wiki_scraper.py` and other files (e.g., `rate_limit_delay`, `timeout`, `cache_ttl_hours`).
2.  Use a library like `pydantic-settings` to load these values from environment variables into a structured settings object.
3.  Update the `.env.example` file to include all new environment variables with sensible defaults.

## Summary

By implementing these recommendations, the `Lol_Data_MCP_Server` will become more robust, easier to deploy, and more maintainable in the long run. The suggested changes align with modern best practices for building scalable and production-ready web services. The highest impact change would be to introduce Docker for containerization.
