# Project Recommendations

This document provides a summary of recommendations for improving the Lol_Data_MCP_Server project.

## High-Level Summary

The project is well-structured and has a comprehensive and ambitious roadmap. The documentation is excellent and provides a clear vision for the project. The current focus on data integration is the right priority, as it forms the foundation for all other features.

## Codebase Recommendations

### 1. Configuration Management (`src/core/config.py`)

*   **Simplify `load_config_files`:** Refactor the `load_config_files` method to reduce code duplication. Create a helper function to load a single YAML file and merge it into the main configuration.

### 2. `WikiScraper` (`src/data_sources/scrapers/wiki_scraper.py`)

*   **Use CSS Selectors:** Replace the brittle regex-based parsing with CSS selectors to target specific HTML elements. This will make the scraper more resilient to changes in the wiki's layout.
*   **Use Specific Exceptions:** Instead of returning error dictionaries, raise specific exceptions (e.g., `StatsParsingError`) to make error handling more explicit and robust.
*   **Externalize Selectors:** Move CSS selectors and other configuration to a separate YAML file (e.g., `config/scrapers.yaml`) to make them easier to update.

### 3. `ChampionService` (`src/services/champion_service.py`)

*   **Decouple from Scraper:** Introduce an intermediate data structure to decouple the service from the `WikiScraper`'s implementation details.
*   **Granular Error Handling:** Catch specific exceptions from the `WikiScraper` to provide more detailed error logging and handling.

### 4. MCP Tools (`src/mcp_server/tools.py`)

*   **Abstract Tool Logic:** Create a base class or helper function to reduce code duplication in the `execute` methods of the tools.

## Task and Roadmap Recommendations

*   **Prioritize Scraper Robustness:** The success of the project depends on the reliability of the data sources. Invest time in making the `WikiScraper` as robust as possible before moving on to other features.
*   **Incremental Riot API Integration:** The Riot API is a large and complex data source. Tackle the integration incrementally, starting with the most critical data points (e.g., champion and item data).
*   **Consider a Database:** For a project of this scale, a database is essential for caching, performance, and data integrity. The plan includes this in Phase 2, which is appropriate.

## Conclusion

This is an excellent project with a lot of potential. The recommendations above are intended to help improve the codebase's quality and ensure the project's long-term success. The development team has done a great job of laying a solid foundation, and I'm excited to see how the project evolves.
